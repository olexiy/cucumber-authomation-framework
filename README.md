## Description

INSERT DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION HERE

## Getting Started

This project is a test automation framework utilizing Cucumber, a Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
tool and Selenium, a popular Open-Source tool for automating web browsers.

This framework allows us to write automated tests in a way that can be easily understood by
all stakeholders in the project since these tests are written in plain English.

The use of Selenium WebDriver allows us to interact with a web page just like a human would.
Combined with the power of BDD that Cucumber provides us, our project ensures that we have high
quality, well-functioning software that meets our business requirements.
